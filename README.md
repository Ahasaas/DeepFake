# Project Title: Deepfake Detection using Machine Learning


## Project Overview:
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of distinguishing between real and fake faces using a dataset sourced from Kaggle. With the growing concerns surrounding deepfake technology, an efficient detection system is crucial to mitigate potential misinformation and fraudulent activities.

# Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is the "Real and Fake Face Detection" dataset, obtained from Kaggle. It contains images of real and computer-generated faces, which will be used for training and evaluation.

Key Steps:

Data Acquisition: The dataset is downloaded and extracted using the Kaggle API.

Preprocessing: The images are resized to a standard format and converted into NumPy arrays for easier manipulation.

Model Training: A machine learning model (such as a Convolutional Neural Network) is trained to classify images as real or fake.

Evaluation & Optimization: The model's performance is assessed using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. Further optimizations are applied as needed.

Deployment & Application: The trained model can be integrated into applications to detect deepfake content in real-world scenarios.

Expected Outcome:
A reliable deepfake detection system that can accurately classify real and fake faces, contributing to the fight against misinformation and fraud.
